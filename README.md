# Neural Networks

Deep learning projects experimenting with different Neural Network concepts.

## Projects

- **Dog Image Generator (GAN)**: Generates realistic dog images using a Generative Adversarial Network.
- **Fraud Detection Simulation**: Simulates transaction data and trains a binary classifier using real-time data via WebSocket.
- **Faces-CNN**: Predicts age from facial images using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the IMDB-WIKI dataset.
- **Flowers Classifier**: Classifies different types of flowers using a CNN trained on image data.
